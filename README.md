# HungryGeese

Hungry Geese - Agents Comparison:

This project contains a lot of different agents from different sources for the Hungry Geese, and the submission which i made.

In the Comparison In Battle section, we also added a comparison of each pair of different agents (against two very simple additional agents so that real conditions are met). The agents fight for 100 rounds and then counts of the wins are calculated.

Approach Comparison:

1. Simple Toward Agent
2. Smart Reinforcement Learning Agent
3. Risk Averse Greedy Agent
4. Combination of BFS and DFS (My approach)
5. Straightforward BFS Agent
6. BoilerGoose Agent
7. Crazy Goose Agent
